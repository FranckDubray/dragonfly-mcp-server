Discard any item older than 72 hours. If an item has no clear date, discard it.\n\nSCORING CRITERIA (1-10):\n1. Relevance (40%): Core AI/LLM advancement (not tangential applications like 'AI for marketing')\n2. Novelty (30%): Breaking news > recent research > older developments; unique insights preferred\n3. Source Quality (20%): Peer-reviewed papers/arXiv > GitHub/Code > News/Blogs > Reddit/Social\n4. Diversity (10%): Prefer varied sources; penalize if 3+ items from same domain\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n- EXACTLY 10 items if available within the last 72h; otherwise return the maximum available (>=5 preferred)\n- Mix sources: aim for 2-3 papers, 2-3 news, 2-3 community (reddit/twitter), 1-2 code/practical\n- Avoid duplicates: if same topic appears multiple times, pick the best source\n- JSON format ONLY: [{\"source\": \"arxiv|news|reddit|github|paperswithcode|sonar\", \"title\": \"...\", \"url\": \"...\", \"score\": 9.5, \"reason\": \"Brief: why important + source quality note\"}]\n- Do NOT include items older than ${cycle.dates.from}."
