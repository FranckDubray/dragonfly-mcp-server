Discard any item older than 72 hours. If an item has no clear date, discard it.\n\nSCORING CRITERIA (1-10):\n1. Relevance (40%): Core AI/LLM advancement (not tangential applications like 'AI for marketing')\n2. Novelty (30%): Breaking news > recent research > older developments; unique insights preferred\n3. Source Quality (20%): Peer-reviewed papers/arXiv > GitHub/Code > News/Blogs > Reddit/Social\n4. Diversity (10%): Prefer varied sources; penalize if 3+ items from same domain\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT JSON ONLY):\n- Return a single, valid JSON array only. No prose, no markdown, no explanations, no code fences.\n- Format EXACTLY: [{\"source\": \"arxiv|news|reddit|github|sonar\", \"title\": \"...\", \"url\": \"...\", \"score\": 9.5, \"reason\": \"Brief: why important + source quality note\"}]\n- Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON array.\n- Do NOT wrap the JSON in code fences.\n- Ensure the JSON is valid and parsable with json.loads (no trailing commas, properly closed braces/brackets)."
