## [1.17.3] - 2025-10-12

### Fixed
- **ollama_local**: Vision support simplified and clarified
  - `operation=generate` now properly documented as THE way to use images
  - `operation=chat` explicitly rejects images with helpful error message pointing to `generate`
  - Removed broken auto-switch logic that was confusing and non-functional
  - Clear documentation: `generate` = images OK, `chat` = text only
  - Example error message guides users to correct usage

### Changed
- **ollama_local**: Massive output cleanup for better LLM token efficiency
  - `generate` response: removed `context` array (internal tokens), raw duration fields
  - `chat` response: same cleanup, keep only essential fields
  - Before: 15+ fields including internal state
  - After: 6 essential fields (success, response/message, model, timing, token counts)
  - Human-readable durations: "12.3s" instead of nanoseconds
  - Output reduction: ~70% fewer tokens for typical responses

### Technical Details
- ollama_local spec: Enhanced descriptions for `generate` vs `chat` operations
- Image support: `image_files` parameter works perfectly with `generate` operation
- Vision models tested: llava:13b confirmed working with local images under docs/
- Error messages: Actionable suggestions with example payloads

## [1.17.2] - 2025-10-12

### Fixed
- **call_llm**: Fixed image path resolution using intelligent project root detection
  - Before: hardcoded `/docs` (system root) causing "file not found" errors
  - After: dynamic path resolution using `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`
  - Images under `docs/` now correctly accessible without DOCS_ABS_ROOT env var
  - Support for `DOCS_ABS_ROOT` override maintained for custom setups
- **ollama_local**: Fixed massive log flooding during model download/upload
  - `pull_model` and `push_model` now return concise summaries instead of 500-2000 lines
  - New `_handle_streaming_response()` aggregates progress and returns structured summary
  - Output reduction: 98-99.6% (from thousands of lines to 5-8 lines)
  - Includes download summary with layer count, total size, and completion percentage
  - Prevents LLM context window saturation and improves token efficiency

### Technical Details
- call_llm: `PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent` for reliable docs/ discovery
- ollama_local: Streaming response aggregation with human-readable size formatting (e.g., "4.3 GB")
- Both fixes comply with LLM_DEV_GUIDE output size policies
