# Changelog

## [1.51.2] - 2025-10-20

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor & Stability
- refactor(engine): split orchestrator_core into logical modules (<7KB each)
  - core_nodes_common.py (begin/exec start/end, scope resets)
  - core_nodes_handler.py (IO/transform execution, retries, mapping, debug)
  - core_nodes_decision.py (decisions, debug)
- fix(engine): remove engine/__init__ import side-effects to eliminate circular imports
- chore(start): purge all debug.* flags at start unless debug.enable_on_start=true
- runner: bootstrap hardened (worker_name/db_file injected)

No breaking changes. Improves debuggability and respects file-size guard.

## [1.51.1] - 2025-10-20

### üõ† Maintenance & Hotfixes
- feat(transforms): add domain transforms `array_ops`, `date_ops`, `json_ops`, and `array_concat`; auto-register on bootstrap
- refactor(utils): centralize UTC timestamp formatting via utils.time.utcnow_str (single source of truth)
- fix(debug): unify pause/resume path; stable step/continue/run_until with proper ctx diffs and previews
- fix(logging): crash logger robust snapshots + full traceback with locals; step logger size capping and truncation flags
- fix(runner): bootstrap crash logging; DB init (WAL, busy timeout) before reads; inject `worker_name` and `db_file` in worker_ctx
- chore(validators/status): clearer validation errors; compact metrics and debug block in status
- feat(http_tool): lightweight debug previews for inputs/messages/output (masked & truncated)
- chore(ai_curation): prompts and subgraphs updated; Sonar user-only prompts; lower quality threshold stays at 7/10

This patch is backward compatible and contains no breaking changes. Recommended upgrade for improved observability and debug stability.
